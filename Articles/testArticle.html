                  After	a	long	day	at	work,	Wally	would	get	home,	put	the	kettle	on,	and	close	the	curtains.	Sitting	down	to	
enjoy	a	hot	tea	in	the	privacy	of	his	own	home,	safe	and	secure	knowing	he	was	finally	alone.	Privacy	is	no	
longer	this	straightforward.	The	digital	age	has	altered	the	very	definition	of	privacy	and	its	impacts	on	
individuals,	families,	and	businesses.	If	Wally	were	to	close	his	curtains,	his	phone	would	still	broadcast	his	
location	to	the	world,	and	companies	would	record	his	conversations	behind	closed	doors.	His	casual	browsing	
of	the	internet	would	be	analyzed,	saved,	and	sold	to	the	highest	bidder.	Even	the	kettle	which	he	boiled	his	
tea	would	be	connected	to	the	internet,	telling	whoever	was	listening	to	Wally's	actions.	This	is	not	some	
dystopian	future,	playing	along	the	lines	of	some	Truman	Show-Esque	parody.	Modern-day	smartphones,	AI,	
high-speed	internet,	and	the	Internet	of	Technology	(IoT)	have	made	it	possible	for	every	action to	be	
recorded	and	every	movement	to	be	tracked.	All	under	the	pretense	of	convenience,	marketing,	and	product	
improvement.	Moreover,	humanity	knows	it;	they	have	fallen	for	the	Privacy	Paradox	(Barth	&	De	Jong,	2017;

                <Strong>Literature	Review</Strong></br>
                The	Privacy	Paradox	is	as	Gerber	et	al.	(2016)	's	states,	has	been	a	topic	of	discussion	for	at	least	ten	years	
                (Smith	et	al.,	2011;	Zafeiropouloi	et	al.,	2013;	Acquisti	et	al.,	2007;	Cho	et	al.,	2010).	They	say	that	the	paradox	
                describes	the	dichotomy	of	privacy	attitude	around	inform	and	privacy	behavior.	On	the	one	hand,	a	user	will	
                express	concern	around	personnel	data	and	will	state	an	urge	to	protect	their	data.	While	simultaneously	
                posting	details	of	their	every	day	online	for	all	to	see,	giving	up	personnel	data	freely	and	making	minimal	
                effort	to	protect	themselves	through	cookies	deletion,	communication	encryption,	etc.	(Gerber	et	al.,	2016).	
                Gerber	et	al.	's	(2016)	paper	to	examine	all	the	relevant	research	to	establish	a	more	precise	understanding	of	
                the	paradox.	They	find	that	attitude	towards	privacy,	concerns,	perceived	risk,	and	behavioral	intentions	are	
                the	main	factors	hinting	towards	social	factors	determining	a	user	participating	in	the	paradox.	Gerber	et	al.	
                (2018)	conclude	that	despite	these	findings,	that	no	definitive	conclusion	can	be	drawn.	Current	research	
                examines	certain	facets	or	areas	of	privacy	in	the	digital	domain.	Currently,	there	is	no	clear	link	apart	from	
                social	constructs,	for	this	paradox	spans	boundaries.
              </br>
            </br>
                Barth	&	De	Jong	(2017)	also	attempt	a	systematic	review	of	the	literature	regarding	the	privacy	paradox.	They	
                state	that	the	electronic	transference	of	data	in	the	data	age	is	at	an	unprecedented	rate,	allowing	for	
                unwitting	users	to	be	observed	around	the	clock	due	to	constant	network	connectivity.	It	is	leading	to	
                extensive	scale	collection	of	data	and	the	term	'Big	Data'	being	coined	(Barth	&	De	Jong,	2017).	Despite	this	
                and	increasing	fears	due	to	hacking	data	scandals	and	misuse,	users	are	more	conscious	of	data	privacy	but	not	
                acting	upon	it.	This	leads	to	the	privacy	paradox.	The	results	of	their	review	conclude	that	rational-decisionmaking	is	not	the	sole	reason	for	users	to	undergo	privacy	practices.	Sometimes	a	clean	user	dashboard	
                presented	on	an	app	will	be	enough	for	a	user	to	divulge	all	information	as	this	professional	and	clean	outlook	
                fosters	trust	in	the	user's	mind.	Therefore,	it	is	proposed	that	this	area	be	investigated	as	privacy	is	fast	
                becoming	a	global	crisis.
              </br>
            </br>
                The	final	pieces	in	this	literature	review	are	that	of	Sicari	et	al.	(2015)	and	Weinberg	et	al.	(2015),	who,	like	
                Caron	et	al.	(2016),	turn	their	academic	lens	to	IoT,	and	the	balance	of	<em>convenience	vs.	privacy</em>.	Sicari	et	al.	
                (2015)	analyze	the	road	ahead	for	IoT	and	privacy,	stating	that	privacy	customization	will	have	to	become	a	
                mandatory	requirement	if	IoT	is	to	spread.	They	state	that	this	is	hard,	though,	due	to	the	heterogeneous	
                nature	and	multitude	of	IoT	devices	(Sicari	et	al.,	2015).	This	provides	a	clear	link	to	the	privacy	paradox	and	
                relations	with	privacy.	It	shows	that	IoT	may	be	too	complicated	or	varied	which,	coupled	with	a	lack	of	
                customization,	causes	users	to	feel	alienated.	Resulting in	them	not	bothering	with	their	privacy	as	it	is	not	
                convenient.	Weinberg	et	al.	(2015)	also	take	up	this	claim,	stating	IoT	is	allowing	for	unprecedented	contact	
                between	consumers,	firms,	and	machines.	IoT,	the	state,	'does	not	exist'	without	data	analysis	and	generation,	
                which	leads	to	substantial	privacy	concerns	(Weinberg	et	al.,	2015,	p	620).	Finally,	they	state	that	privacy	by	
                design	is	a	possible solution	to	this	issue.	They	are	highlighting	a	possible	solution	for	the	privacy	paradox,	
                alluding	that	it	may	occur	due	to	a	lack	of	good	design.	Laziness	and	unintuitive	design	are	causing	consumers	
                engaging	in	the	privacy	paradox.
              </br>
            </br>
                So a	multitude	of	academic	journals are	both	directly	referring	to	the	
                privacy	paradox	and	also	referring	to	it	indirectly.	Stating	how	new	IoT	devices	in	the	digital	age	are	causing	
                privacy	concerns. But where does that lead us?
