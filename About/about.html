                SIMPLICITY. A concept that my name is simple. Or so I initially thought upon first starting my journey into the IT world. 
                But in the IT-sphere, that can mean a multitude of different things. 
                Is coding an elaborate algorithm from scratch that takes months to perfect but effectively removes a business process and followed every software methodology simple? 
                Or is following frameworks and adapting other solutions into your own to achieve a fast result but has circumvented some rules simple? 
                The end game and accompanying products are somewhat the same. So, what do we want? I wish I had the answer to that question. 
                It plagues almost every time I sit down to think out a technical solution or begin coding. I've spoked to academics who seem to contradict each other. 
                "Why reinvent the wheel?" â€“ "Following this methodology removes dependencies, removing a chance of failure down the track!". 
                Possibly the answer is there is no answer, each project is different, each programmer is other, and each team or business just as diverse. 
                I believe the answer is somewhere in between but has anyone found it yet?
                I am Joshua Ryland, an aspiring, technically savant who enjoys thinking up simple solutions to complex problems,  Automation, and how people's minds work. 
                I believe software, development, and the tech 'world' isn't as removed from the human psyche as people think. By delving further into that mixture, we may find some surprising results. 
                The current obsession that plagues my brain is that of automation. Why are there so many processes out there that don't need to be done by a human? 
                Let's get the world on a path where people can be allowed to be people. 
                Let's make it so that when a company hires someone, you hire them as a human capable of independent thought and coming up with unique solutions to complex problems. 
                Robots and scripts can do the paper-pushing and button mashing. Humans can do what we do best, be human. To achieve this, let us all embrace automation and all that it entails.

                A master's in information technology given with first-class honors from the University of Auckland. 
                Reinforced by years of experience in diverse fields such as environmental surveying and full-stack development. 
                I've seen how the mundane and fully automatable tasks can weigh down a business and the individual. 
                My passion is to fix that. If you would like to chat, head over to my contact page, and get in touch.
